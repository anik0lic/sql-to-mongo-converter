# SQL to MongoQL Converter
SQL to MongoQL Converter is a university project developed to enhance the understanding of connecting application to databases, while also facilitating the learning process of SQL and MongoDB syntax.

The tool will allow users to write SQL queries, which will then be validated, parsed, and translated into the appropriate format (MongoQL). The translated query will be executed in the MongoDB database, and the returned collection of documents will be organized into a structure suitable for tabular representation.

## Running
The recommended way is to clone the repository and run ***Main*** class. You need Java 11 or later versions.
